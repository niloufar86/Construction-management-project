# Construction-management-project
Data on construction projects for schools in NYC Data is available at City of New York opendata portal and contain information on the status of projects completion, planned and actual duration, planned and the actual cost of project for different phase of the projects. Due the existing uncertainties during implementation, actual cost/completion time might be different from the estimation during planning phase, which is typical in construction projects. The goal is to develop a predictive model for actual project duration and project cost based on planned time and planned cost.
